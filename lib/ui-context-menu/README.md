This element will be improved once the menu behavior is more solid.
At the moment (Jul 27 2016) the menu's behavior is still in prototype
so code is writen directly in the js (see interactions/context-menu).

That is to provide a better space for quickly prototyping behaviors before
implementing a good component.
